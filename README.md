Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of diabetes onset based on health parameters. By analyzing various health indicators like glucose levels, BMI, and insulin, this project provides a data-driven approach to identifying individuals at risk for diabetes. The model was built and evaluated using popular machine learning algorithms.
Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset, which contains medical records of patients, including the following features:

	•	Pregnancies
	•	Glucose
	•	Blood Pressure
	•	Skin Thickness
	•	Insulin
	•	BMI (Body Mass Index)
	•	Diabetes Pedigree Function
	•	Age

The target variable is a binary outcome (0 for non-diabetic and 1 for diabetic).
